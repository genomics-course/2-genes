    "### What are functions?\n",
    "A function is used to perform a task based on a particular input. Functions are the bread and butter of any programming language. We have used many functions already that are builtin to the objects we have interacted with. For example, we saw that `string` objects have functions to capitalize letters, or add spacing, or query their length. Similarly, `list` objects have functions to search for elements in them, or to sort.\n",

    "The next step in our journey is to begin writing our own functions. This is only an introduction, as we will continue over time to learn many new ways to write more advanced functions.  "
