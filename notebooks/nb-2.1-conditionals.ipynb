This means that the objects have a built-in structure that allows us to easily look at each of their individual data points in order. \n",

    "The `for` statement in Python can be used to iterate over iterable objects. Here, it creates a new variable in each iteration and assigns it the next value from the iterable object. Below, we use the variable name `element` to store the value in each iteration, but this variable can be named whatever you want. In other words, the syntax here is used to assign temporary values to a named varaible (here, element) and to repeat this for each item that is in the larger iterable object (mylist). "

    "### The `range` and `len` functions \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `range` is a special highly efficient operator for iterating over numeric values. It has the form `range(start, stop, step)`, and returns an object that generates numbers on the fly as they are sampled. This makes it highly efficient since if you tell it to generate a billion numbers it doesn't need to generate them ahead of time but instead generates them only as they are needed. `range` is important since it is often used in conjunction with sequence type objects to sample their index. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful function that is often used it tandem with `range` is the function `len`, which stands for *length*. It is used to measure the length of an iterable object, meaning it will tell you how many elements are inside of it. One way that these two functions are combined is to ask `range` to return a sequence of integers that is the same length as an iterable object. This will allow you to iterate over the entire index of an iterable object. (Experts will know there is also a related methods called `enumerate` that can be used for this.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below we iterate over every element in dna by calling `len(dna)` which returns an integer and wrapping that inside of range which returns a sequence for that entire length. "

This is essentially a way of rewriting a multi-line for-loop statement into a single line. The point of list comprehension is to make your code more compact and easier to read.
